excerpt: 'We address the issue of uniqueness for sums of nonvanishing squares; that is, we
determine all positive integers N that can be represented as a sum of k ≥ 5 nonvanishing squares in essentially only one way. Our methods are elementary and
are based on a lower bound on the number of 1s that must be present in such a
representation.'
