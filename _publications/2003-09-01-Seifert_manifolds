title: "The integral homology of orientable Seifert manifolds"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2003-09-01-Seifert_manifolds
excerpt: 'For any orientable Seifert manifold $M$, the integral homology group $H_{1}(M) = H_{1}(M;\mathbb{Z})$ is computed and explicit generators are found. This calculation gives a presentation for the $p$-torsion of $H_{1}(M)$ for any prime $p$. Since Seifert manifolds have dimension $3$, $H_{1}(M)$ determines 
$H_{\ast}(M;A)$ and $H^{\ast}(M;A)$ as well, for any abelian group $A$. The complete details are given when $A = \mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}/p^{s}$.

In order to calculate the partition functions of the Dijkgraaf–Witten topological quantum field theories it is necessary to compute the linking form of the underlying $3$-manifold. In the case of the orientable Seifert manifolds it is possible to compute the linking form. The calculation of the linking form involves finding a presentation of the torsion of the first integral homology of the orientable Seifert manifolds, which is the main result of this paper.'
