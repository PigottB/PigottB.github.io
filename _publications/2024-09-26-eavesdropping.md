title: "Eavesdropping on the BB84 Protocol using Phase-Covariant Cloning: Experimental Results"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-09-26-eavesdropping
excerpt: 'Though the BB84 protocol has provable security over a noiseless quantum channel, the security is not proven over current noisy technology. The level of tolerable error on such systems is still unclear, as is how much information about a raw key may be obtained by an eavesdropper.
	We develop a reproducible test to determine the security--or lack thereof--of the protocol in practice.
This enables us to obtain an experimental estimate of the information that can be obtained using asymmetric phase-covariant cloning to eavesdrop on the BB84 protocol.'
