excerpt: 'It is shown that a one-dimensional damped wave equation with an odd time derivative nonlinearity exhibits small amplitude bifurcating time periodic solutions, when the bifurcation parameter is the linear damping coefficient is positive and accumulates to zero. The upshot is that the singularity of the linearized operator at criticality which stems from the well known small divisor problem for the wave operator, is entirely removed without the need to exclude parameters via Diophantine conditions, nor the use of accelerated convergence schemes. Only the contraction mapping principle is used. '

It is shown that a one-dimensional damped wave equation with an odd time derivative nonlinearity exhibits small amplitude bifurcating time periodic solutions, when the bifurcation parameter is the linear damping coefficient is positive and accumulates to zero. The upshot is that the singularity of the linearized operator at criticality which stems from the well known small divisor problem for the wave operator, is entirely removed without the need to exclude parameters via Diophantine conditions, nor the use of accelerated convergence schemes. Only the contraction mapping principle is used.
