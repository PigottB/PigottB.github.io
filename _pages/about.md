I am currently an Associate Professor of Mathematics at Wofford College. I earned my PhD in Mathematics from the University of Toronto in 2011 where my advisor was [James Colliander](https://colliand.com/). My graduate research was focused on the stability of solitons for generalized Korteweg-de Vries equations. 

Upon earning my PhD I moved to Wake Forest University where I was a Teacher-Scholar Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Mathematics. My research mentor there was [Sarah Raynor](https://math.wfu.edu/raynor).
