I am currently an Associate Professor of Mathematics at Wofford College. I earned my PhD in Mathematics from the University of Toronto in 2011 where my advisor was [James Colliander](https://colliand.com/). My graduate research was focused on the stability of solitons for generalized Korteweg-de Vries equations. 

Upon earning my PhD I moved to Wake Forest University where I was a Teacher-Scholar Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Mathematics. My research mentor there was [Sarah Raynor](https://math.wfu.edu/raynor). 

In Spring 2022 I was on sabbatical and had the pleasure of working with [Elizabeth Campolongo](https://egrace479.github.io/) and Hardik Routray (Rutgers University) as part of the QuForce Innovation Fellowship. We worked on a problem that has to do with using phase-covariant cloning to eavesdrop on the BB84 protocol. Hardik produced an online demonstration of how such an attack might work; [BB84 protocol with asymmetric cloning](https://bb84-cloning.herokuapp.com/). Our work was presented as part of the QuForce Demo Day on August 8, 2022.
